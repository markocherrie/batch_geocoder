# batch_geocoder

Put test.csv in your home directory, it should contain a "str" column with the address you want to geocode.

Run the code at start to input your keys and geoghelper information.

Specify in the for loop if you would like all geocoders (i.e. comparison analysis) or just one (i.e. for batch) 

Remember to create a directory called "results"
 
To do: create  a function that does all this ^ allowing the user to specify the relevant arguments! Does the job at the moment though :)
